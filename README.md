# Odoo-Config
Set of files necessary to run and execute Odoo via debugging and python virtual envs in Visual Studio Code with Ubutnu and in other linux derivates.

My apologies, this guide is not for Pycharm yet, some tinkering around for an afternoon might do it.

Please take a look into the wiki for the instructions.

Important to know here is that this guide is for linux. Please note that ubuntu installs the soon-2-be deprecated python 2.7 alias that as python, while python 3 is not installed by default and addressed as python3 and the pypi installer as pip3. You need to work around a virtualenv by this.
